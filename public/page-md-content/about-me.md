Welcome to my journal. 
I'm Charlie, a backend engineer working out of San Francisco.  
I currently lead engineering at a series A startup called [Conversion](https://conversion.ai).  
My mission is to build and own software that shapes industries and impacts customers.

I also believe **strongly** in:

* 1 10x person > 20 1x people  
* Being fulfilled > being happy  
* Grit > intellect  
* ΔBody ∝ ΔMind
